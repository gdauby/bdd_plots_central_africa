\item{add_taxa_info}{Add taxonomic information (family, genus, species)}

\item{trait_ids}{Vector of trait IDs to filter (NULL = all traits)}

\item{categorical_mode}{How to aggregate categorical traits: "mode" (most frequent) or "concat" (all unique values)}

\item{format}{Output format: "wide" (pivoted) or "long" (raw measurements)}

\item{include_remarks}{Include measurement remarks}

\item{include_measurement_features}{Add measurement-level features/metadata}

\item{con_taxa}{Connection to taxa database (optional)}
}
\value{
List with components:
  - traits_raw: Raw trait measurements with resolved taxonomy
  - traits_numeric: Numeric traits (aggregated if format="wide")
  - traits_categorical: Categorical traits (aggregated if format="wide")
}
\description{
Retrieves trait measurements associated with taxa, with automatic resolution
of taxonomic synonyms. Traits linked to synonyms are consolidated under the
accepted taxon name.
