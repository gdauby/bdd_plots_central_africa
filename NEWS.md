## plotsdatabase 1.4 (Development)

### New Features

* **Traits enrichment module in taxonomic matching Shiny app**
  - New tab "Enrich with Traits" allows enriching matched taxonomic names with trait data from the taxa database
  - Aggregates multiple input names that match to the same taxon into a single row
  - Concatenates all input names (e.g., "cola edulis | coula edrulis" â†’ "Coula edulis")
  - Configurable options for categorical trait aggregation (mode vs concatenation)
  - User can select which columns to include (original names, corrected names, IDs, metadata)
  - Downloads enriched data as Excel file
  - Filters out `id_trait_measures` columns for cleaner output
  - Module: `mod_traits_enrichment_ui()` and `mod_traits_enrichment_server()`

* **Enhanced file upload in taxonomic matching Shiny app**
  - CSV file support added (in addition to Excel .xlsx and .xls)
  - Excel sheet selector allows choosing which sheet to import from multi-sheet workbooks
  - Sheet selector appears dynamically after Excel file upload
  - Default sheet selection is the first sheet
  - CSV files are loaded directly without sheet selection

### Bug Fixes

* **Fixed NA input names appearing in trait enrichment**
  - Enrichment module now filters out rows where the input taxonomic name is NA or empty
  - Prevents invalid NA entries from being matched to taxa or included in enriched output
  - Applied in both trait fetching and result aggregation steps

* **Fixed incorrect input names in enrichment output**
  - Enrichment now correctly uses the user-selected taxonomic name column (not first column of dataset)
  - `column_name` parameter now passed from main app to enrichment module
  - Ensures `input_names` column shows actual taxonomic names from the selected column

### Code Refactoring

* **Optimized taxonomic name cleaning for faster matching**
  - Name cleaning (removing "sp.", "cf.", "aff.", etc.) now happens **before** batch exact matching
  - Previously, cleaning only occurred during slow fuzzy matching phase
  - Names like "Coula edulis sp." now match exactly to "Coula edulis" in fast batch step
  - Significantly reduces number of names sent to slower fuzzy matching
  - Cleaning happens once at beginning, benefiting all matching steps (species, genus, family)
  - Both original and cleaned names preserved in matching pipeline

### Breaking Changes

* **`query_taxa()` default behavior changed**: `exact_match` parameter now defaults to `TRUE` (was `FALSE`)
  - Exact matching is now the default for family/genus/order queries to prevent unexpected fuzzy matching results
  - For species queries, if exact match fails, the function automatically falls back to intelligent fuzzy matching
  - **Action required**: Code relying on fuzzy matching by default should explicitly set `exact_match = FALSE`
  - Rationale: Higher taxonomic ranks are standardized names where fuzzy matching rarely helps and can introduce errors

### New Features

* **Intelligent taxonomic name matching** with genus-constrained fuzzy search
  - New `match_taxonomic_names()` function implements hierarchical matching strategy:
    1. Exact matching (fastest)
    2. Genus-constrained fuzzy matching (searches species only within matched genus)
    3. Full fuzzy matching (last resort)
  - Dramatically improves match quality by restricting fuzzy search space
  - Includes synonym detection and resolution
  - Supports scoring and ranking of multiple matches
  - New helper functions: `parse_taxonomic_name()`, `.match_exact_sql()`, `.match_genus_constrained_sql()`, `.match_fuzzy_sql()`

* **Auto fuzzy fallback for species queries**
  - `query_taxa()` automatically retries with fuzzy matching when exact species match fails
  - Transparent user feedback shows match quality (similarity score)
  - Handles typos and spelling variations automatically
  - Only applies to species queries; family/genus/order use exact matching only

* **Database enhancement: `tax_level` field added to `table_taxa`**
  - New column explicitly indicates taxonomic level: "species", "genus", "family", "order", "infraspecific", "higher"
  - Indexed for query performance
  - Eliminates ambiguity between missing data and genus/family-level taxa
  - Script provided: `add_tax_level_field.R` for database migration
  - All query functions updated to use new field for cleaner, more reliable filtering

### Code Refactoring

* **Complete rewrite of `query_taxa()`** to use new intelligent matching functions
  - Eliminated redundancy with `helpers.R` functions
  - 8 new modular helper functions replace complex inline logic
  - Cleaner separation of concerns: matching, filtering, synonym resolution, formatting, trait addition
  - ~160 lines of code removed through better abstraction
  - Better maintainability and extensibility
  - Deprecated `query_fuzzy_match()` and `query_exact_match()` in favor of `match_taxonomic_names()`

* **Simplified taxonomic level filtering** using `tax_level` field
  - Replaced complex multi-column checks (e.g., `is.na(tax_esp) & is.na(tax_gen)`) with simple `tax_level == "family"`
  - Applied in `query_taxa()` for clearer intent and better performance via index usage

### Bug Fixes

* **Fixed `query_taxa()` empty results with `only_family = TRUE`**
  - Previously, fuzzy matching by default caused empty results when filtering for family-level taxa
  - Now uses exact matching by default for higher taxonomic ranks

### Dependencies

* Added new package dependencies to DESCRIPTION:
  - `cli` - User-friendly command line interfaces (moved from Suggests to Imports)
  - `lifecycle` - Manage function lifecycle (deprecation warnings)
  - `data.table` - High-performance data manipulation
  - `glue` - String interpolation for SQL queries
  - `RecordLinkage` - String similarity calculations

## plotsdatabase 1.0 (Development)

### Breaking Changes
* **Database schema change**: Renamed column `ind_num_sous_plot` to `tag` in `data_individuals` and `followup_updates_individuals` tables
  - All R package functions updated to use new column name
  - **Action required**: External scripts accessing `ind_num_sous_plot` must be updated to use `tag`
  - Updated files: `R/functions_manip_db.R`, `R/individual_features_function.R`, `R/functions_divid_plot.R`, `R/generate_plot_summary.Rmd`, `structure.yml`
  - Default parameter in `approximate_isolated_xy()` changed from `tag = "ind_num_sous_plot"` to `tag = "tag"`

### New Features
* Initial release of package structure with comprehensive database query functions
* **Enhanced `update_ident_specimens()`**: Now shows summary of linked individuals before updating specimen identification
  - Displays which plots and how many individuals will inherit the new identification
  - Shows current taxonomic identification of linked individuals
  - Provides better context for informed decision-making before confirmation
  - New helper function `.get_linked_individuals_summary()` queries and summarizes impact

### Bug Fixes
* **Connection error with complex home paths**: Fixed `create_db_config()` function that failed when home directory path contained spaces or special characters (e.g., OneDrive paths like `C:/Users/NOBUS CAPITAL/OneDrive/Documents/`)
  - Added proper error handling with `tryCatch()` for file creation
  - Creates parent directories if they don't exist
  - Falls back to in-memory configuration if file cannot be written
  - Users now get informative warnings instead of connection failures

### Documentation
* Added comprehensive README.md with package overview, quick start guide, and function reference
* README includes prominent link to NEWS.md for tracking updates

### Infrastructure
* Added NEWS.md to track package changes and updates
* Established git branching workflow for all code modifications

### Code Refactoring
* **Major refactoring**: Reorganized `R/functions_manip_db.R` (previously 10,528 lines) into modular, domain-specific files
  - Created `R/growth_census_functions.R` (556 lines) - Growth computation and census analysis functions
  - Created `R/specimen_linking_functions.R` (406 lines) - Herbarium specimen linking and querying functions
  - Created `R/taxonomic_query_functions.R` (944 lines) - Taxonomic query functions with synonym resolution
  - Created `R/taxonomic_update_functions.R` (838 lines) - Taxonomic data update and entry functions
  - Expanded `R/connections_db.R` with database query utilities (`func_try_fetch`, `try_open_postgres_table`)
  - Removed ~6,800 lines from `R/functions_manip_db.R` through extraction to specialized modules
  - All functions verified as moved (not duplicated) to new locations
  - Improved code maintainability and discoverability
